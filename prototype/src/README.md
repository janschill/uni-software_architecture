# How to run

first install requirements (preferably through a [virtual
environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))

``` sh
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

then run the `run.py` file:

``` sh
python3 run.py
```

and just follow the prompted questions ;)
