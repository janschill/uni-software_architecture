## The descriptions are clear and concise for you to understand key functionalities and boundaries of the system. Context diagram uses appropriate UML notation.

> I think it is a good idea of a system. The main purposes and features are well explained. Context diagram is well drawn with notations.
> I am curious why you decided not to include Arbejdstilsynet in the context diagram.

## Are there at least 2 architectural concerns identified in the project? If so what are they and do they seem relevant and appropriate for the project?

> Yes. The architectural concerns are identified and described well, and relevant for the project.

## Quality attribute workshop was carried out and results and discussions are well explained? In the QAW key stakeholders were identified and their concerns were incorporated? Scenarios are described with important attribute fields.

> Yes, QAW process is well managed and explained.
> Scenario 2 has 'Artifact' empty. There are 2 scalability scenarios, and to me they sound like availability issues. (Forgive me if I understood them wrong.)

## Appropriate architectural styles, patterns and tactics were chosen to formulate overall design of the application? What are the strengths and weaknesses of these.

> I think it is written well here. The tactics make sense, but a bit more detailed explanation related to the system/project could be nicer. 

## It is easy to understand the system from the different view points using 3+1 approach? All views are included? If some aspect of the system was difficult to understand explain it.

> All views are included and drawn very detailed.
>I think in C&C diagram the components in a square should have : in front of their names and underlined. (fx. :App, as you did in the allocation diagram) Also for allocation diagram, I think the platform should have different notation/shape. I am >not totally sure, though.

## Is there one or more issues identified to resolve in the architectural prototype? If so what is/are they? What is the hypothesis about the prototyping. Have they argued for why issues(s) is important? Is it clear if they used experimental or explorative approach?

> It is clear you used exploratory and experimental prototype to find out the suitable message queuing system.

## Does the report contain a clear description/method of how the prototyping was carried out? Does the prototyping exercise deliver some results that can be used for decision making? What are the implication of the prototyping for the design of the system?

> It is very clear and well described. The result of the prototyping part is clear as well.

## Which method did they use (ATAM or aSQA). Is there a sound argumentation for the choice given the system?

> They used aSQA and using iterative development strategy makes sense to choose aSQA. Considering this question, you might want to give 'a sound argumentation for the choice' a bit more detailed than current version. ;)
> It is well explained why you used different score scale.

## How many iteration of the evaluation did they carry out? Which component(s) did they do the architectural evaluation on? Is there a conclusion that details implications of their design so far?

> It seems that you did one iteration of the evaluation for the 'after prototype' version. I believe it is required that we evaluate before/after prototype versions if we are using aSQA method.
> It is nice you wrote more detailed on each quality attributes' results.

## Architectural Backlog - is there evidence of evolving architectural backlog some of which has been addressed and some have not. What's most interesting to you?

> I think the backlog shows your time and effort in this project. Automatic flag for names and swears seems interesting.
> I recall getting advice that the architectural backlog should not be a to-do list for the group project itself. Even though it is a bit confusing (at least for me), consider removing elements fx. Be concrete in what part is exploratory and 
> prototype.
