# Architectural Drivers 


## Security
- "As an employer want to make sure that feedback is actually from their employers"
- "An an employee i want to be able to, without fear of repricusion,
  complain/feedback an issue in my workplace"
- "As an employer i would like to not get personally attacked"

## Modifiability
- "As a developer i would like to quickly integrate with new services"
- "As a System Owner i want it to be cheap to integrate new companies"


## Scalability
- "As an employer i want to quickly start using this tool"
- "As the System Owner i want to minimize unused resources"

## Interoperability
- "As HR i want to be able to create a plan of attack"
- "As an employee i would like to easily see a list of new issues in my
  communication platform of choice"
- "As an employer i want to select how people authenticate and signnup (i.e with
  specific email domain or azure etc)"
