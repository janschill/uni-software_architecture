# Basic vision

A platform where employees can post questions and issues on a board for other
employees to see, anonymously. They can rate and comment on other issues.
Employees and can see and consider these issues. Daily/weekly status can be
show on integration-tools and be exported to jira/trello etc. It&rsquo;s not as much
an end to end chat, as much as like piazza/yodl/thing maybe?
